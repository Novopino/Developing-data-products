Coursera assignment

This assignment has two parts. Firstly, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.
Secondly, we should use e.g. Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.
This presentation addresses the second part of the course project.
